=== Gemini SDK Test Report ===

=== PART 1: CONTEXT TESTS ===
--- 1.1 Testing Chat Session Resumption ---
Created new chat session: 3126d907-dddb-4c46-9394-88da084546f0
Sent: My name is Gemini Explorer.
Sent: What is my name?
Result: Your name is Gemini Explorer.

--- 1.2 Testing File-based Context ---
Step 1: I will write 'Context test: Step 1 passed' to `context_file.txt`.
The file `context_file.txt` has been created with the text "Context test: Step 1 passed".
Step 2: I will read the `context_file.txt` to understand its contents.
The `context_file.txt` contains a confirmation that "Step 1" of a context test has passed.


=== PART 2: FUNCTIONALITY TESTS ===
--- 2.1 Testing 'agent' mode (standard) ---
Result: I will create a file named `mode_test.txt` and populate it with the current date and time.
The file `mode_test.txt` has been created with the current date and time.

--- 2.2 Testing 'ask' mode ---
Result: The capital of France is Paris.

--- 2.3 Testing 'planner' mode ---
Result: I will build a modern, responsive Todo application using **Next.js** (React) and **TypeScript**. The application will follow **Material Design** principles and use **Bootstrap** for layout and styling.

### High-Level Plan

1.  **Project Initialization**: Scaffold a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
2.  **Core Component Development**: 
    *   `TodoForm`: A sleek input area for adding new tasks.
    *   `TodoList`: A container that manages the display of tasks.
    *   `TodoItem`: Individual task cards with completion toggles and delete actions.
3.  **State & Persistence**: Use React hooks to manage the todo list state and persist data to `localStorage` for a seamless user experience across sessions.
4.  **Filtering & Organization**: Implement filters for "All", "Active", and "Completed" tasks to help users stay organized.
5.  **Polished UI/UX**: Apply Material Design styling (elevations, specific color palettes, and spacing) using Bootstrap and custom CSS for a premium look and feel.

I will begin by initializing the project environment.

--- 2.4 Testing 'debug' mode ---
Result: I will read the contents of `buggy.py` to understand the current implementation of the `power` function.
I'll create a test file `test_power.py` to verify the current bug and ensure the fix works as expected.
I will run the `test_power.py` script to confirm that the current implementation of the `power` function fails the tests.
I will now correct the logic in `buggy.py` by replacing the `+` operator with the `**` operator in the `power` function.
I will run the `test_power.py` script again to verify that the fix correctly implements the `power` function and passes the tests.
I'll remove the `test_power.py` file now that the fix has been verified.
The logic in `buggy.py` has been fixed: the `power` function now correctly uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) instead of addition. Verification with a test script confirmed the fix.
