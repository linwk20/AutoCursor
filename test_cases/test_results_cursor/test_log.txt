=== Cursor Agent SDK Test Report ===

=== PART 1: CONTEXT TESTS ===
--- 1.1 Testing Chat Session Resumption ---
Created new chat session: e0422c8a-6e68-4658-a0d2-00c67ff5a481
Sent: My name is Cursor Explorer.
Sent: What is my name?
Result: Your name is Cursor Explorer. How can I help you today?

--- 1.2 Testing File-based Context ---
Step 1: I've written 'Context test: Step 1 passed' to `context_file.txt`.
Step 2: The file `context_file.txt` contains a brief status message indicating that the first step of a context test has been successfully completed.

**Summary:**
- **Status:** Step 1 passed
- **Subject:** Context test


=== PART 2: FUNCTIONALITY TESTS ===
--- 2.1 Testing 'agent' mode (standard) ---
Result: I have created the file `mode_test.txt` with the current date and time: `Fri Jan  2 11:53:14 AM EST 2026`.

--- 2.2 Testing 'ask' mode ---
Result: The capital of France is Paris.

--- 2.3 Testing 'planner' mode ---
Result: I've created a detailed plan for building a simple Todo app in Python. Since the workspace appears to be Python-focused, I'm proposing a robust CLI-based application that can be easily expanded later.

### **Phase 1: Architecture & Data Design**
*   **Stack:** Python 3.x
*   **Storage:** `todos.json` (JSON format for easy readability and portability).
*   **Data Model:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "task": "Buy groceries",
      "completed": false,
      "created_at": "2026-01-02T..."
    }
    ```

### **Phase 2: Core Functionality (The Logic)**
1.  **Storage Engine:** Functions to load and save data to the JSON file safely.
2.  **CRUD Operations:**
    *   `add_todo(text)`: Appends a new item with a unique ID.
    *   `list_todos()`: Displays todos with formatting (e.g., `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for done).
    *   `mark_complete(id)`: Updates the status of a specific task.
    *   `delete_todo(id)`: Removes a task from the list.

### **Phase 3: User Interface (CLI)**
*   Use Python's built-in `argparse` module to handle commands like:
    *   `python todo.py add "Finish the report"`
    *   `python todo.py list`
    *   `python todo.py done 1`
*   Add colorized output (optional) using ANSI escape codes for better UX.

### **Phase 4: Implementation Steps (Order of Work)**
1.  **Setup:** Initialize the project file and a sample `todos.json`.
2.  **Data Layer:** Write the `load` and `save` helpers.
3.  **Features:** Implement the Add and List functions first.
4.  **Updates:** Implement Complete and Delete functions.
5.  **Refinement:** Add error handling (e.g., what happens if a user tries to delete a non-existent ID).

**Would you like me to proceed with this plan, or would you prefer a Web-based version (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI)?**

--- 2.4 Testing 'debug' mode ---
Result: I've fixed the bug in `buggy.py`. The `power` function was using addition instead of exponentiation.

```1:2:/home/lwk/ur_research/cursor-agent-sdk/test_cases/test_results_cursor/buggy.py
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b  # Correct logic, should be a ** b
```
